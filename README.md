# jarvis

Jarvis enables you to easily create web aplications that use speech recogniton.

## Usage

FIXME

## TODO
The first main steps that need to be accomplished before anything else
can be done.

* Get cmuSphinx working well in clojure.
* Capture audio from javascript and send it to the server in a form
that can be used by cmuSphinx.

Then later all the fun can come,

* Control panel for setting up apps.
* Make a heroku app that does the stt and the rule matching.
* Flesh out the javascript library.
* Profit!
